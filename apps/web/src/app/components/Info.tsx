          I made (or rather improved upon) this simlation because understanding
          natural selection is fundamental to our study of life. Everyone can
          and should know it. Plus, it's really cool!

        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          This is an evolution simulation. Hover over a bug to eat it. Try to
          eat as many bugs as you can without letting your "hunger timer" run
          down to zero. After a minute or so of eating bugs, you will notice
          that the bugs will be harder to find. That's because the population is
          evolving to be more camouflaged with the environment.

          How Does Natural Selection Work?
        </div>
        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          If evolution is the observed phenomenon of hereditary change over
          time, then natural selection is the mechanism of that change. As for
          how it works, Richard Dawkins puts it most succinctly. Natural
          selection is "the differential survival of replicators."
        </p>

        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          Or, to expand this into a few bullet points:
        </p>

        <ul className="mb-2.5">
          <li>
            Some things in the world make copies of themselves - they replicate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The copying process is really good, but not perfect. There is
            variation among replicators.
          </li>
          <li>
            Because variation exists, some replicators are better at replicating
            than others.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a world of finite resources, replicators replicating means that
            other replicators can't replicate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Successful replicators are thus metaphorically "selected" by nature.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          Let's pursue these points in further detail.
        </p>

        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          As it turns out, there are things in the world that, because of their
          physical structure, automatically assemble copies of themselves.
          Dawkins points out that while replicators can in principle be made out
          of any material, the one's we are most familiar with are the moleules
          we call our genes. Or more specifically, the strands of DNA contained
          in most of our cells.
        </p>

        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          It's hard to overstate what amazing trick replication is. For
          comparison, if a salt molecule is like putting on flip flops, then DNA
          is like intercepting an cruise missile by shooting a laser out of your
          butt.
        </p>

        <p className=" text-base mb-2.5">
          Paradoxially, any replicator worth it's salt will have in imperfect
        </p>
